# Conclusion

- We can test the guids filter.

- We can add new filter criteria without needing to modify the toggleReadBooks method.
  For example say that the guids that are `< 100` are not filtered.

- We don't need to mock the user object.

- We can test the code directly on a REPL.

- The function input are just primitives.

- The user object is not modified.

- Our code becomes more reusable, since it doesn't depend on a specific implementation of the user object.

- Our methods only expects a list of guids.

- The only loose end in this code is if the readBooksById methods fails (due to a DB connection error).

- Keep It Simple.
